# Retain.me Smartslip PHP Example
A php curl example for the retain.me order api</br>
This example allows information to be passed into an array, encoded into a JSON format then posted via curl to the api</br>
For the sake of this example the array is hard coded but the curl will work fine with a dynamic array
